Combine multiple streams
======

===
1) mergeAll() - subscribes to all given streams

===
2) concatAll() - in sequence, for each stream:
subscribes to it, when it's complete, then subscribes to another and so on

===
3) switchAll() - subscribes to only most recent (last) stream that has produced values,
 unsubscribes("cancels") from previous pending streams

===
4) exhaustMap() - if there is no pending stream then subscribes to passed stream
else ignores that stream
